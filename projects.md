These are the projects I've worked on. Will keep on updating it on github. Don't forget to check it out.

### [Covid 19 Analysis](https://github.com/missjaanii/Covid19Analysis)
Just an ongoing project for covid 19 analysis with some visualisation. Will Keep on updating. Base project. Open the file in Google colab to check the density mapbox graph and press the play button on it to see the animated effect.

### [Stock Trading Basics](https://github.com/missjaanii/StockTradingBasics)

Just some basic stock trading using python for beginners.

### [Prediction of Train Dataset Logistic Regression](https://github.com/missjaanii/Train-Dataset-Logistic-Regression)

Applied the logistic regression on the train dataset with a test size of 0.32.

### [Prediction of Boston Housing Dataset using linear regression model](https://github.com/missjaanii/Boston-Housing-Dataset-linear-regression-model)

Applied linear regression model algorithm on the in-built boston housing dataset. Took a test size of 0.27 to get the desired r squared error value and prediction accuracy. You might want to take whatever suits your model.

### [Heart Disease Prediction ](https://github.com/missjaanii/HeartDiseasePrediction)

Heart Disease Prediction using Cleveland's Heart Disease dataset using Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier with 99% accuracy rate.

### [KNN clustering on Wheat Seed Dataset] ](https://github.com/missjaanii/WheatSeedKNN)

Applied a KNN model algorithm on Wheat seed dataset. Also showed some pairplots. I used the test size of 0.475 which gave me accurate results. It might not work for you so try the trial and error method for near-perfect results.

To construct the data, seven geometric parameters (features) of wheat kernels were measured:

area A,

perimeter P,

compactness C = 4piA/P^2,

length of kernel,

width of kernel,

asymmetry coefficient

length of kernel groove

target (0,1,2)

### [Matplotlib visualisations on an Iris Dataset ](https://github.com/missjaanii/IrisDataset)

Played a bit around using some advanced matplotlib techniques on the famous iris dataset.
<hr>

### [Natural Language Processing Basics ](https://github.com/missjaanii/NLPbasics)

Just some basic code of Natural language processing to get the gist of it. Will update more if I can, later on.
<hr>

### [Visualisation using Bokeh ](https://github.com/missjaanii/Bokeh-Basics)

Visualized the in-built iris dataset using Bokeh.
